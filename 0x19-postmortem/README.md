Issue Summary:
On May 8th, 2023, our company's e-commerce website went down during a flash sale event, leaving 75% of our users frustrated and unable to shop. The website's load balancer was caught off guard by the sudden increase in traffic, causing a bottleneck at the database level.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a classic case of "underestimating the power of a good sale." Our load balancer was not prepared to handle the massive influx of bargain-hungry shoppers.

Timeline:

9:30 AM EST: Chaos ensued as the website crashed and users were unable to shop.
9:35 AM EST: The engineering team frantically attempted to diagnose the issue, only to find that the load balancer was overwhelmed by the surge of traffic.
10:00 AM EST: After a few cups of coffee and some serious brainstorming, the team realized that the issue was at the database level and not with the load balancer.
10:30 AM EST: The team tried to increase the database's capacity but quickly hit a wall due to hardware limitations.
11:00 AM EST: The issue was escalated to the database administration team, who quickly identified the root cause and implemented a temporary fix.
12:45 PM EST: The website was finally back up and running, allowing shoppers to continue their bargain hunting.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
The engineering team initially suspected the load balancer to be the root cause, but after some investigative work, they found it was innocent and merely a victim of the sale's overwhelming success.

Escalation:
The issue was escalated to the database administration team, who put on their superhero capes and quickly saved the day.

Resolution:
The database administration team implemented a temporary fix, which involved optimizing the database queries and increasing the server's memory capacity. With a few high-fives and fist bumps, they were able to get the website back up and running.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent future outages, our team will be implementing the following measures:

Load testing before flash sale events to ensure the website is prepared for high traffic.
Increasing the database's hardware capacity to handle sudden traffic surges.
Adding real-time monitoring to the database to detect and respond to potential bottlenecks before they cause an outage.
Encouraging shoppers to take a breather, do some stretching, and practice mindfulness before jumping on our next sale.
In conclusion, while we apologize for the frustration our users experienced during our flash sale, we hope you were able to get a good laugh out of our post-mortem. Just remember, never underestimate the power of a good deal, and always make sure your load balancer is ready for the rush!
